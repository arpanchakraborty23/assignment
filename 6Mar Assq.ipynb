    "Q2. Define the different types of statistics and give an example of when each type might be used.\n",
    "=>  There are two types of statistics \n",
    "        - Descriptive: Discrite stat used to organize and summerize data\n",
    "        - inferential: Inferential stats used to prediction of data\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. What are the different types of data and how do they differ from each other? Provide an example of \n",
    "each type of data\n",
    "=> There are two types of data\n",
    "\n",
    "1.quantative: It reprasents numarical values.it also have two types  --\n",
    "        A. Discrit: It reprasents whole numbers. ex- no of phone of a person.\n",
    "        B. Conuntinues: It reprasents float and integer no .ex- weight of a boy.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Qualative : It reprasents catagorical features.    it also have two types --\n",
    "        A. Nominal: it is catagorical data use for labaling of data without values. ex-Gender\n",
    "        B. Odinal : Odinal data also a caagorical data but their are spacific order or rank among the catagorical values.\n",

    "Q4. Categorise the following datasets with respect to quantitative and qualitative data types:\n",
    "=> \n",
    "(i) Grading in exam: A+, A, B+, B, C+, C, D, E =Qalatative ordinal\n",
    "(ii) Colour of mangoes: yellow, green, orange, red =Qalative nominal\n",
    "(iii) Height data of a class: [178.9, 179, 179.5, 176, 177.2, 178.3, 175.8,...] == quantative Conuntinues\r\n",
    "(iv) Number of mangoes exported by a farm: [500, 600, 478, 672, ... == quantative discrit\n",

    "Q5. Explain the concept of levels of measurement and give an example of a variable for each level.\n",

    "A. Nominal : This is a basic level of measurment, variabeles are catagoeize without values.\n",

    "C.Ratio:  order of the variable matters and diffrance between variables mattes. it start from 0.\n",

    "Q6. Why is it important to understand the level of measurement when analyzing data? Provide an \n",
    "example to illustrate your answer\n",
    "=> If we can't which kind of of data we deal with we can't perfrom any opration statistical analysis or  on it .\n",
    "\n",
    "ex-  grade levels have a natural order (e.g., 1st grade, 2nd grade, etc.), the numerical difference between grade levels is not consistent or meaningful. Treating grade levels as interval or ratio data and calculating measures such as the mean or standard deviation would be inappropriate because they imply quantitative differences between grades that don't exist.\n",
